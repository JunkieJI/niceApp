# niceApp
Sample app for niceJob interview

Created a basic react application to demonstrate my ability to setup a new project 
and create components in order display users from an API as well as  allow for the
ability to rate these users.


To keep it simple various compromises were made:

- The users data is from an online API: https://reqres.in/api/users.
- There are active issues with testing functional components using enzyme, I didn't want
 to spend too much time investigating this so I changed my approach to use class based 
 components for Users and UserCard.
- Used react-bootstrap to keep styling simple
